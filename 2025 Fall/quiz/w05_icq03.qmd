1. The Hardy-Weinberg equation is $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$.  
Which part of this equation would you use to calculate the percentage of individuals expressing:   
    a. The dominant phenotype? **(1 pt)**  
    b. The recessive phenotype? **(1 pt)**

2. What in-text citation (in APA format) would you use for this reference? **(2 pt)** \linebreak

5. A rat population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium has $p(A) = 0.8$.  
    a. What is the percentage of individuals having homozygous recessive genotype? **(1 pt)** \linebreak
