1. A population of hippopotamus has two skin colour phenotypes, white and dark. The white phenotype is coded by the genotype *aa* while the dark phenotype is coded by *AA* and *Aa*. The recessive allele frequency, $p(a) = 0.2$. Calculate the following and show your work:  
    a. Allele frequency of *A* **(1 pt)** \linebreak  
    b. Frequency of each genotype in the population **(1.5 pt)** \linebreak \linebreak  
    c. Proportion of dark-coloured hippopotamus in the population **(1 pt)** \linebreak \linebreak  

2. Ecologists are often concerned by species with small population sizes. The figure below highlights one of the reasons for this concern. Using this figure, answer:  
    a. Name one evolutionary process associated with smaller population sizes. **(1 pt)** \linebreak  
    b. What are the independent and dependent variables here? **(2 pt)** \linebreak \linebreak  
    c. Assuming that the bars represent average values from 5 replicates, list 3 things missing from this figure. **(1.5 pt)**

    a. Write an alternative hypothesis and a prediction for this experiment. **(2 pt)** \vspace{2in}

4. Your colleague ran the AMP conditions you specified in Q3 using three replicates, and collected the AMP data in the table below. Use this data to fill in the provided figure (next page) with a bar graph having error bars and a figure caption. Make sure to label the axes and specify the actual conditions. You can use information from Q3. **(7 pt)**  

```{r}
#| fig-width: 6

tribble(
  ~ "", ~ "Average (n = 3)", ~ "S.D.", 
  "Condition 1", "0.8", "0.1",
  "Condition 2", "0.65", "0.2",
  "Condition 3", "0.5", "0.1",
) |>
  knitr::kable(align = "c")

ggplot(tibble(x = "", 
              y = c(0, 1)),
       aes(x = x, y = y)) +

9. The current environment of pepper moths (*Biston betularia*) has mostly light grey trees and therefore favours white-mottled moths. In a benchtop bean assay, the allele conferring white-mottled colouring (white bean) is recessive and has a fitness of 1. The black-mottled allele (black bean) has a fitness of 0.5.
